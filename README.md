# Original-Snack
This branch contains a version of the application that was the submission intended for the first exam session of the course (a.y. 2021-2022).
It was entirely developed on [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev) and therefore is very buggy given that that development environment lacks a very crucial feature of development, namely debugging.
The project is affected by an issue of "too many callbacks" and is intended to be used as an example case (since it is not working).
